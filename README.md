This is a snapshot of Thomas R's TACTICS Plugin for OpenCPN. V 1.009....

I am using this to figure out the API and Plugin interactions with each other and the base application.
It may be broken mostly will be :)

If your looking for a stable version look at another repo.

I've fixed some of the deprecited (_T) in the code
